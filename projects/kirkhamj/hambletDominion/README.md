#assignment 5 instructions
run command "make assignment5" to run non-random and random tests for cards Adventurer and Smithy.

My teammates and I otherwise shared no other refactored cards from assignments 2 and 3.

Test results and coverage will output to nonrandomtestresults.out and randomtestresults.out

To see verbose test output, set the #VERBOSITY macro in each of the test's .c files to a value of 1.
Then make clean and re-make the files as instructed above.
